# C-PRINTF
Wrote C's built-in printf function as ft_printf

In C programming language, printf() function is used to print the (“character, string, float, integer, octal and hexadecimal values”) onto the output screen.
We use printf() function with %d format specifier to display the value of an integer variable.
Similarly %c is used to display character, %f for float variable, %s for string variable, %lf for double and %x for hexadecimal variable.
To generate a newline,we use “\n” in C printf() statement.

On this project I,
- handle file descriptors to output characters,
- handle decimal to hexadecimal conversion,
- handle [variadic functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variadic-functions-in-c/)
